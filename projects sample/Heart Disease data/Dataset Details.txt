Dataset columns:

    age: The person’s age in years

    sex: The person’s sex (1 = male, 0 = female)

    cp: chest pain type
    	— Value 0: asymptomatic
    	— Value 1: atypical angina
    	— Value 2: non-anginal pain
    	— Value 3: typical angina

    trestbps: The person’s resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

    chol: The person’s cholesterol measurement in mg/dl

    fbs: The person’s fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)

    restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
    	— Value 0: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes’ criteria
    	— Value 1: normal
    	— Value 2: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)

    thalach: The person’s maximum heart rate achieved

    exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

    oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (‘ST’ relates to positions on the ECG plot.

    slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment — 0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping
    	0: downsloping; 
	1: flat; 
	2: upsloping

    ca: The number of major vessels (0–3)

    thal: A blood disorder called thalassemia Value 0: NULL (dropped from the dataset previously
	    Value 1: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart)
	    Value 2: normal blood flow
	    Value 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)

    target: Heart disease (1 = no, 0= yes)
